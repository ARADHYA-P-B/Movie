# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
Create the Movie project to design the Movie and WatchList

- In that project I used tailwind.cong-gig
- I used React Hooks for state management.
- I used React States for State Management.
- I used React Prope for the project.
- I used React Components are 
          - Movies Component
          - Navigates Component
          - WatchList Component
          - Banner Component
          - Pagination Component
          - MovieCard Component
          - MovieModal Component
          - MovieDetails Component
          Icones are the used for that project.
